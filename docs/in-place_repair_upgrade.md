# In-place Repair Upgrade

(Keeping files and apps)

---

In-place repair upgrade using Windows ISO file is a good way to fix system errors. Here's how you can perform it.

-   Download the Windows ISO, preferably from [MSDL](https://msdl.gravesoft.dev/) in the **same Windows language, and architecture**.
    -   To check the installed Windows architecture, open Powershell as admin and enter,  
        `Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem | Format-List OSArchitecture`
        If you are using PowerShell 7 or later and getting error such as `'Get-WmiObject' is not recognized`, use this command instead:
        `Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem | Format-List OSArchitecture`
        x64 means 64 Bit, x86 means 32 Bit
    -   To check the installed Windows Language, open Powershell as admin and enter,  
        `dism /english /online /get-intl | find /i "Default system UI language"`
    -   Note: If you are running the Enterprise LTSC edition, you will need to download that edition's ISO file. Don't download Evaluation version, that can't be activated.
-   Right-click on the downloaded ISO file, Open With > Windows Explorer
-   A new DVD drive will appear in Windows Explorer, which means the installation image has been mounted successfully.

-   Go into that DVD drive and run setup.exe, just continue until you reach the final confirmation screen.
-   Make sure it says "**Keep personal files and apps**" on the final screen. Then you can continue the process and wait until it is done.
